The Code Maven site is for people who are interested in programming. It grew out from the
<a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> site that deals exclusively with programming in Perl.

The Code Maven site, on the other hand, will cover all kinds of subjects.

For now, the guiding line is everything that interests the authors
(mostly <a href="http://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>), but guest-posts are also welcome.

<h2>Planned Topics</h2>

Currently the planned subjects are <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>,
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> and JavaScript in general.

<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.

<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.

Perl probably is not going to be covered here as it is being covered on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> and on
the <a href="http://perl6maven.com/">Perl 6 Maven</a> sites.

<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>.

HTML/CSS or if you prefer HTML5/CSS3.

...just to name a few....
